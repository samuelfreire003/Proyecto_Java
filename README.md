# Proyecto_Java

This project was developed as a hands-on exercise to deeply understand core Java concepts, focusing on object-oriented programming, especially polymorphism, and the full software development lifecycle. It includes UML diagrams for planning and design, a clean object-oriented structure, and a set of unit tests to ensure functionality and reliability. The goal was to simulate the development of a basic project management system, applying principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and interface implementation. It also emphasizes writing maintainable code, understanding class responsibilities, and practicing test-driven development (TDD).
